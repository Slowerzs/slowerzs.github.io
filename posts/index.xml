      <description>While reading this article from James Forshaw on leveraging COM to inject code into a process, I discovered a syscall that I didn&amp;rsquo;t known about: NtSystemDebugControl.&#xA;Being unfamiliar with this syscall, I decided to look for more information. I found this PowerShell snippet, which worked well to dump kernel-mode memory. Looking for more, I found that the Flags argument was an enum that contained a IncludeUserSpaceMemoryPages. As the name suggests, if this flag is specified, the memory dump will include user-mode pages that are not swapped out.</description>

      <description>ThievingFox is a collection of post-exploitation tools, used to gather credentials from workstations and servers in the context of penetration tests and similar engagements. It works by making the target application load a malicious library, which performs in-memory hooking to gather credentials.&#xA;During pentests, I&amp;rsquo;ve had great successes using KeeThief and mimikatz&amp;rsquo;s ts::mstsc module to gather additional credentials from KeePass and the default RDP client on Windows, on compromised admin workstations.</description>
